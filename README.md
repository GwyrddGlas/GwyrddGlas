### Hey! I'm GwyrddGlas 👋  

I'm a Lua developer transitioning from GTA5 scripting into full game development with LOVE2D.

#### 🎮 What I'm Working On  

**Pulse** 🎵  
*Planned Release: 2026*  
A rhythm game where precision and timing matter. Hit the notes, chase perfect combos, and push your limits. Still in development. More info coming as it shapes up!

**GBR Manager 2026** 🃏  
*Release: TBD*  
Details under wraps for now. Stay tuned!

#### 💬 A Bit About Me  

Right now I'm focused on leveling up from modding to building complete games. I'm diving deep into game systems, polish, and making gameplay feel right.

Always down to collaborate on rhythm games or interesting Lua projects. If you want to chat about game design, rhythm mechanics, or just nerd out about code, hit me up.
